## Reporting Issues / Contributing

**When reporting issues**, please include the following items in the thread with a descriptive title:

- The Spigot server version you are running

- A stack trace enclosed in code tags

- A brief description of the error

  

**For contributing purposes**, pull requests are welcome, but I do ask that you attempt to not branch outside the scope of this plugin.  This program is not intended to be extremely complex or feature-packed.   To summarize, small features are more appropriate.
